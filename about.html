            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Mindaugas, a 30-year-old with a passion for the outdoors, programming, and personal growth. I used to work as a carpenter, but medical problems made it difficult for me to continue in that field. So, I decided to
                pursue my interest in technology and started studying front-end development.
            </p>
            <p>I am a proud father of two kids and a loving husband to my wife. My family and my dog Luna are the most important things in my life, and I am constantly striving to become a better person, husband, and father.</p>
            <p>
                Raising children is one of the biggest challenges and joys of life, and I am dedicated to making the most of this experience. I believe that a strong family foundation is essential for a happy and fulfilling life, and I am
                always looking for ways to strengthen my relationship with my wife and kids.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my family life, I have a deep passion for the outdoors and enjoy activities such as skiing and climbing. I also have a love for programming and am always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge in
                this field.
            </p>

            <p>
                In this blog, I will be discussing the challenges and triumphs of becoming a software developer. I will also share tips on life-work balance, raising children, and pursuing your passions. Join me as I navigate through this
                exciting journey and become a better person, programmer, and husband. Let's grow together!"
